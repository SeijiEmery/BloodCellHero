Todo:
– Projectile / Enemy collision not generating OnCollisionEnter events; should be destroyed on hit but aren't (see Projectile.cs)
– Projectiles not moving towards player; should be able to start initial motion with AddForce, but not working.
– Player can move with directional keys; probably fine but might want to disable this. Just using a FPS character with gravity disabled atm.
– Enemies should probably be attached to things that move, not move themselves
– All non-trivial mechanics

Progress so far:
– EnemySpawner spawns enemies within circle at fixed intervals; should add more complex controller system later
– PlayerGun has a Fire() method that spawns projectiles
– All motion done (so far) with rigidbodies
