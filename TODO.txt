Todo:
– Player can move with directional keys; probably fine but might want to disable this. Just using a FPS character with gravity disabled atm.
– Enemies should probably be attached to things that move, not move themselves (working on this)
– All non-trivial mechanics

Progress so far:
– EnemySpawner spawns enemies within circle at fixed intervals; should add more complex controller system later
– PlayerGun has a Fire() method that spawns projectiles
– All motion done (so far) with rigidbodies
